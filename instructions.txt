Tabbouleh Recipe 

Ingredients: 
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup fine #1 bulgur wheat
3 bunches fresh curly parsley finely chopped (about 3 packed cups)
2 firm tomatoes finely chopped
2 green onions finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh mint finely chopped

Instructions: 
1. Whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. 
Stir in the bulgur. Let the grains soak up the dressing until they are plump and most of 
the moisture is absorbed for about 20 to 30 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, add the parsley, tomatoes, green onions, and mint to one side of the large 
bowl with the bulgur, but don't mix yet.

3. When the bulgur is plump, and the lemon-olive oil mixture is mostly absorbed, stir 
everything together until well combined. Serve at room temperature or chilled from the fridge.
